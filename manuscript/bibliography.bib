  abstract={The widespread use of quantile regression methods depends crucially on the existence of fast algorithms. Despite numerous algorithmic improvements, the computation time is still non-negligible because researchers often estimate many quantile regressions and use the bootstrap for inference. We suggest two new fast algorithms for the estimation of a sequence of quantile regressions at many quantile indexes. The first algorithm applies the preprocessing idea of Portnoy and Koenker (Stat Sci 12(4):279–300, 1997) but exploits a previously estimated quantile regression to guess the sign of the residuals. This step allows for a reduction in the effective sample size. The second algorithm starts from a previously estimated quantile regression at a similar quantile index and updates it using a single Newton–Raphson iteration. The first algorithm is exact, while the second is only asymptotically equivalent to the traditional quantile regression estimator. We also apply the preprocessing idea to the bootstrap by using the sample estimates to guess the sign of the residuals in the bootstrap sample. Simulations show that our new algorithms provide very large improvements in computation time without significant (if any) cost in the quality of the estimates. For instance, we divide by 100 the time required to estimate 99 quantile regressions with 20 regressors and 50,000 observations.}

The advantage of this approach is that it allows the use of methods that are only valid in the estimation of conditional means, while still providing information on how the regressors affect the entire conditional distribution. The methods we propose are not meant to replace the well-established quantile regression estimator, but provide an additional tool that can allow the estimation of regression quantiles in settings where otherwise that would be difficult or even impossible. We consider two settings in which our approach can be particularly useful: panel data models with individual effects and models with endogenous explanatory variables. Besides presenting the estimator and establishing the regularity conditions needed for valid inference, we perform a small simulation experiment, present two simple illustrative applications, and discuss possible extensions.}

abstract = {The paper examines the relationship between heterogeneity bias and strict exogeneity in a distributed lag regression of y on x. The relationship is very strong when x is continuous, weaker when x is discrete, and non-existent as the order of the distributed lag becomes infinite. The individual specific random variables introduce nonlinearity and heteroskedasticity; so the paper provides an appropriate framework for the estimation of multivariate linear predictors. Restrictions are imposed using a minimum distance estimator. It is generally more efficient than the conventional estimators such as quasi-maximum likelihood. There are computationally simple generalizations of two- and three-stage least squares that achieve this efficiency gain. Some of these ideas are illustrated using the sample of Young Men in the National Longitudinal Survey. The paper reports regressions on the leads and lags of variables measuring union coverage, SMSA, and region. The results indicate that the leads and lags could have been generated just by a random intercept. This gives some support for analysis of covariance type estimates; these estimates indicate a substantial heterogeneity bias in the union, SMSA, and region coefficients.}

abstract = { Conventional regression techniques focus on the conditional averages, but often of more interest are lower or upper conditional quantiles. A more informative description of the relationship among variables can be obtained through regression quantiles (RQ). The percentile curves are usually computed one level at a time. Associated with great flexibility is the embarrassing phenomenon of quantile crossing. We propose a restricted version of regression quantiles (RRQ) that avoids the occurrence of crossing while maintaining sufficient modeling flexibility. RRQ remains in the general framework of the regression quantiles both conceptually and computationally. Because it relates all quantile functions through the conditional median, it also means substantial savings in computation costs when multiple quantiles for high-dimensional data are needed. Two examples in connection with the physical and engineering sciences are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of RRQ curves. }

The degree of this shrinkage is controlled by a tuning parameter λ. It is shown that the class of estimators is asymptotically unbiased and Gaussian, when the individual effects are drawn from a class of zero-median distribution functions. The tuning parameter, λ, can thus be selected to minimize estimated asymptotic variance. Monte Carlo evidence reveals that the estimator can significantly reduce the variability of the fixed-effect version of the estimator without introducing bias.}

Second, I embed this estimator into an improved version of the generalized within–estimator of Guimarães and Portugal (2010) and Gaure (2013), replacing their projections with symmetric ones amenable to conjugate gradient acceleration, guaranteeing monotonic convergence. The proposed estimator has the fastest known asymptotic running time, and performs particularly well with large datasets and high–dimensional fixed effects. Morever, by combining insights from graph theory, it opens the door to further improvements on the estimation and inference of models with multi–way fixed effects.},

The properties of the QR method are well established for cross-sectional models; see the landmark monograph by Koenker for references and discussion. A conceptually simple way of applying the QR method to panel data is to model the conditional quantile of the response variable given the regressors and individual effect as the addition of the individual effect and a linear function of the regressors, and then apply fixed effects estimation by treating the individual effects as parameters to be estimated. The chapter describes a few extensions of QR methods for longitudinal data to models with endogeneity, semiparametric QR models for longitudinal data.},

Previous studies on the subject have been hampered by inadequate measures of teacher training and difficulties in addressing the non-random selection of teachers to students and of teachers to training. We address these issues by estimating models that include detailed measures of pre-service and in-service training, a rich set of time-varying covariates, and student, teacher, and school fixed effects. We find that elementary and middle school teacher productivity increases with experience (informal on-the-job training). The largest gains from experience occur in the first few years, but we find continuing gains beyond the first five years of a teacher's career. In contrast, we do not find a consistent relationship between formal professional development training and teacher productivity. However, this may be partly driven by estimation issues as we find more significant positive effects of formal training in the subject-grade combination where estimates should be most precise (middle school math). There is no evidence that teachers' pre-service (undergraduate) training or college entrance exam scores are related to productivity.},

The model is estimated using longitudinally linked employer–employee data from France. Structural results for mobility show remarkable heterogeneity with both positive and negative duration dependence present in a significant proportion of firms. The average structural returns to seniority are essentially zero, but this result masks enormous heterogeneity with positive seniority returns found in low starting-wage firms.},

abstract = {The penalized least squares interpretation of the classical random effects estimator suggests a possible way forward for quantile regression models with a large number of “fixed effects”. The introduction of a large number of individual fixed effects can significantly inflate the variability of estimates of other covariate effects. Regularization, or shrinkage of these individual effects toward a common value can help to modify this inflation effect. A general approach to estimating quantile regression models for longitudinal data is proposed employing ℓ1 regularization methods. Sparse linear algebra and interior point methods for solving large linear programs are essential computational tools.}

abstract = {Summary Estimating the conditional quantiles of outcome variables of interest is frequent in many research areas, and quantile regression is foremost among the utilized methods. The coefficients of a quantile regression model depend on the order of the quantile being estimated. For example, the coefficients for the median are generally different from those of the 10th centile. In this article, we describe an approach to modeling the regression coefficients as parametric functions of the order of the quantile. This approach may have advantages in terms of parsimony, efficiency, and may expand the potential of statistical modeling. Goodness-of-fit measures and testing procedures are discussed, and the results of a simulation study are presented. We apply the method to analyze the data that motivated this work. The described method is implemented in the qrcm R package.},

First, we provide rigorous proofs under reasonable assumptions; second, we provide numerical support in favor of this approach. Indeed, a Monte Carlo study demonstrates attractive finite-sample properties compared to the status quo, in terms of both estimation and inference.},

We show that the mean squared error (MSE) of the vector of the SEE is minimized for some h {\textgreater} 0, leading to smaller asymptotic MSE of the estimating equations and associated parameter estimators. The same MSE-optimal h also minimizes the higher-order type I error of a SEE-based χ2 test and increases size-adjusted power in large samples. Computation of the SEE estimator also becomes simpler and more reliable, especially with (more) endogenous regressors. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate all of these superior properties in finite samples, and we apply our estimator to JTPA data. Smoothing the estimating equations is not just a technical operation for establishing Edgeworth expansions and bootstrap refinements; it also brings the real benefits of having more precise estimators and more powerful tests.},
